# wguMobileApplicationV2
WGU C196

This Mobile application is meant to simulate a student portal where students can add, modify, or delete Semesters, Courses, Tests, and Professors.  The application is written to be accessible in both landscape and portrait and is meant to run on a phone rather than a tablet.  It has the ability to set alarms and send prepopulated text messages. The application implements a ROOM database and has the ability to prepopulate the database with "Harry Potter" themed data.

To Current Students:  Please check to ensure that you are not breaking any WGU rules by viewing my code. If you would like to continue, I have tried to add comments to each section of my code to explain my logic.  If I had the project to do over again I would have used a test driven approach to advance my project and I wouldve caught several small (read: hard to find) computational errors, and I wouldve saved a couple of weeks of debugging and re-coding.
If you would like to reach out, I am more than happy to chat with anyone as you learn from, laugh at, or vomit over my code.  I am happy to talk through any problems and I love learning with my peers.  I am still a new programmer and any chance to learn and explore new methods with my fellow night owls is welcome.  Enjoy....... or Don't   (its really your choice).
